# Numpy

AI Saturday Lagos has different section but I am a co-instructor for Data Science track.This repository is prepared for the class.
After going through this repo and classwork you should be able to manipulate data with numpy.

Most of the code was gotten from this video. Thank you freeCodeCamp.org for making the course stressless.
Check out the video if in doubt https://youtu.be/QUT1VHiLmmI
